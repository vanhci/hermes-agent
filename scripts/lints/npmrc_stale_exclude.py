"""Stale ``min-release-age-exclude[]`` entries in ``.npmrc`` files.

The ``min-release-age`` gate blocks npm from *resolving* package versions
younger than N days (supply-chain quarantine). An exclude exists to let
resolution pick a specific younger release — usually a vuln fix whose
comment literally says "remove when > 2wks old". Once every locked
version of the excluded package is itself older than N days, resolution
succeeds without the exclude: it is dead weight and a standing hole in
the age gate for that package. This lint automates exactly the removal
instruction those comments carry.

Semantics per exclude pattern (exact name, ``@scope/*``, or trailing
glob), matched against the sibling lockfile's locked packages:

- pattern matches no locked package  -> stale (nothing to exempt)
- every matched locked version was published more than
  ``min-release-age`` (+1 day boundary grace) days ago -> stale
- any registry fetch fails -> pattern skipped (fail open: never remove
  an exclude on partial data; worst case it survives one merge cycle)

Opt-out: a ``# lint: keep`` comment anywhere in the entry's comment
block exempts the whole block (for intentional standing excludes like
fast-moving upstreams).

The fixer deletes stale exclude lines; an entry group's comment block
goes with it only when every exclude in the group was removed.
